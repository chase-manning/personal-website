# Contribution Guide

Hi and welcome to the contribution guide!  
Thanks for considering to contribute to the website.

## Found a Bug

If you have found a bug, great job!  
Please don't hesitate to create an Issue for it so it can be fixed.  
Please make sure to add the `bug` Label, and if appropriate, the `good first issue` Label.  
If you want to fix the bug yourself, then also assign the Issue to yourself and keep reading!

## Got a Suggestion

Suggestions to improve the website or codebase are very welcomed!  
Please first create an Issue with the idea.  
If it improves the site for visitors, assign it the `enhancement` tag, or if it is technical, then assign it the `technical` tag.  
If the goal of the suggestion is to try increase visitor conversion, then we will need to validate it to prove that it increases conversion.  
Just be sure to add the `requires validation` tag, and I will take care of doing the validation once you have created a PR.

## Issues

There are a bunch of [open issues](https://github.com/chase-manning/Personal-Website/issues) that would be great if you could help with.  
Feel free to work on any issue that isn't already assigned to someone.  
Issues that are tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/chase-manning/Personal-Website/labels/good%20first%20issue) are the best place to start.

## Development Workflow

Make your changes in this branch until you are happy.  
And then create a PR back into Master.
